# NBA_Assessment

In this project, I will be using this [data set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattop/nba-draft-basketball-player-data-19892021?resource=download) to do analysis on the NBA draft. The data is saved in this repository as [nbaplayersdraft.csv](https://github.com/anath703/NBA_Assessment/blob/main/nbaplayersdraft.csv).


## Part 1: Data Comprehension

**(A)** Which NBA team(s) has drafted the most players who…
- Went to Duke and were drafted in or before the 2000 draft?
- Have a first name that begins with D and were drafted in an even year draft (1990, 1992, 1994, …)?

**(B)** Describe the relationship between a team’s first round pick slot in one year with their first-round pick slot in
the subsequent year.

## Part 2: Analytical Acumen: 

Analyze draft position value and team success/deficiencies compared to expectation

**(a)** Create a method for valuing each draft slot in the NBA Draft (picks 1 through 60 in most drafts).

**(b)** Conditional on the expected value of the draft positions, which **NBA teams** have over or
underperformed the most when drafting during this time span. Which **College Teams** have had the players
outperform expectations the most after entering the NBA?

**(c)** Explain and present your findings with tables and visuals. What additional research areas would you
focus on if given the opportunity to expand this study?
