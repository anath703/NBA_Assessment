# NBA_Assessment

In this project, I will be using this [data set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattop/nba-draft-basketball-player-data-19892021?resource=download) to do analysis on the NBA draft.


## Part 1: Data Comprehension

**(A)** Which NBA team(s) has drafted the most players who…
- Went to Duke and were drafted in or before the 2000 draft?
- Have a first name that begins with D and were drafted in an even year draft (1990, 1992, 1994, …)?

**(B)** Describe the relationship between a team’s first round pick slot in one year with their first-round pick slot in
the subsequent year.
